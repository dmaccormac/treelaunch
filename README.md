# Overview
TreeLaunch is a launcher application for Windows. It allows you to manage items using groups which are then displayed in a Windows Explorer style tree.
It is designed to be lightweight, flexible and portable. You can launch any program that can be started from the command line or Windows Run box.

It also provides a time logging feature which keeps a history of how long you work with each item in the tree.


# Installation
- Download the latest release https://github.com/dmaccormac/treelaunch/releases
- Unpack setup files and run setup.exe.

TreeLaunch can be uninstalled using 'Programs and Features' in Control Panel.

# Usage
To start TreeLaunch, navigate to the TreeLaunch entry in your Start Menu.

The default tree file *SampleTree.xml* will be loaded when TreeLaunch starts for the first time.
You may edit this file as needed or create a new file elsewhere in the system.

TreeLaunch has the following menu options which can be seen by right-clicking on the Tree.

## Launch
Start the selected Item. You can also launch an item by double-click on it.

## Open XML
Choose an XML tree file to open. This setting will be saved by TreeLaunch for the next time you open the program.
 
## Edit
Open the current XML tree file in the default editor (Window Notepad).

## Refresh
Refresh the current tree if you have made any changes to the XML tree file. The tree should automatically refresh itself in most cases.

## View Log
View the TreeLaunch.log file. Each time an item is started or closed it is recorded in the log file along with a timestamp. 

## Always on Top
Select the *Always on Top* option to keep the TreeLaunch window above all other windows.

## About
Display the *About* message.

# Configuration

## XML Tree File
TreeLaunch uses an XML document to store entries in the Tree. 

*SampleTree.xml* which comes pre-loaded with TreeLaunch shows several useful examples including remote connections such as Microsoft Remote Desktop, SSH and VPN.

Below is a small example of the XML format used by TreeLaunch. 

	<Tree>
		<Group Name="My First Group">
			<Item Name="Notepad" Command="notepad.exe" />
			<Item Name="Calculator" Command="calc.exe" />
		</Group>
	</Tree>
	
You can create as many items and groups as needed using the example shown above or by using *SampleTree.xml* as a starting template. 

## XML Tags
TreeLaunch uses three XML tags to store tree information: *\<Tree\>*, *\<Group\>* and *\<Item\>*.
Further explanation of the XML tags and attributes is given below. Refer to the XML example above if necessary.

### \<Tree\> Tag
The entire tree must be enclosed in *\<Tree\>* tags. No additional attributes required.

### \<Group\> Tag
Used to group several *\<Item\>* tags together. It can be named using the required *Name* XML attribute and an optional icon can be displayed using the *Icon* attribute.

	Attribute	Required? 	Info
	---------	---------	------
	Name		Required 	Shown in Tree as Item Name.
	Icon		Optional	Path to PNG icon file to be used for the item.

### \<Item\> Tag
The *\<Item\>* tag is used to create items which are essentially commands to be executed, usually along with additional customized parameters, and an optional Icon.

The 'Item' tag has four attributes as follows:

	Attribute	Required? 	Info
	---------	---------	------
	Name		Required 	Shown in Tree as Item Name.
	Command		Required 	Command to be launched.
	Parameters	Optional	Additional parameters to pass to command.
	Icon		Optional	Path to PNG icon file to be used for the item.

## Icons
Custom icons can be added to *Group* and *Item* objects in the Tree. TreeLaunch comes with four default icons included in the program installation folder:

	- folder.png
	- computer.png
	- tool.png
	- website.png

These PNG icons are size 16 x 16. You can add your own icons as needed using the *<Icon>* tag and the path to your own custom icons.
